    <title>Glossary</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>I created a glossary by creating a glossgroup then creating a glossentry inside the
            glossgroup for each term and defining it.</p>
        <p>The glossary does not work in the DITA PDF output but does work when built in the DITA
            Map WebHelp Responsive.</p>
